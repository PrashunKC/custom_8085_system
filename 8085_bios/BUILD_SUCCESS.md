# âœ… Build Complete - BIOS System Fully Operational!

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Your 8085 BIOS System has been successfully built and is now running!

### What Was Built

1. **Python-based 8080/8085 Assembler** (`tools/assemble.py`)
   - Custom assembler that doesn't require external dependencies
   - Handles all 8080/8085 instructions
   - Supports labels, EQU directives, ORG, DB, DW
   - âœ… Successfully assembled 680 bytes of BIOS code

2. **BIOS Monitor ROM** (`build/bios.bin` - 680 bytes)
   - Assembled from `src/bios.asm`
   - Loaded at address 0x0000
   - Contains interactive monitor with commands
   - Ready to run on the emulator

3. **Enhanced 8085 Emulator** (`8085_bios_system`)
   - Based on your original emulator
   - Extended with I/O port callbacks
   - Qt5 GUI with interactive terminal
   - âœ… Compiled and running now!

### Current Status

```
âœ… BIOS assembled: build/bios.bin (680 bytes)
âœ… Emulator compiled: 8085_bios_system  
âœ… GUI launched and waiting for you!
```

## How to Use Right Now

The GUI window should be open on your screen. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Load the BIOS
Click the **"Load BIOS"** button in the GUI
- This loads the 680-byte BIOS ROM into memory at 0x0000
- Sets the Program Counter (PC) to 0x0000

### Step 2: Run It
Click the **"Run"** button
- The 8085 starts executing from 0x0000
- You should see the BIOS banner appear in the terminal!
- A `>` prompt will appear

### Step 3: Try BIOS Commands
Type these commands in the terminal:

- `H` - Display help
- `D 0000 20` - Dump 32 bytes from address 0x0000  
- `M 2000` - Modify memory at 0x2000 (type hex bytes, press `.` to finish)
- `G 2000` - Jump to and execute code at 0x2000

## Testing the System

### Quick Test Program

Create a file `test.asm`:
```asm
        ORG 2000h
start:
        MVI A, 'H'      ; Load 'H'
        OUT 1           ; Output to console
        MVI A, 'i'      ; Load 'i'
        OUT 1           ; Output to console
        MVI A, '!'      ; Load '!'
        OUT 1           ; Output to console
        MVI A, 13       ; CR
        OUT 1
        MVI A, 10       ; LF
        OUT 1
        HLT             ; Halt
```

Assemble it:
```bash
python3 tools/assemble.py test.asm test.bin
```

Load in GUI (Load Program button), then in BIOS terminal type:
```
G 2000
```

You should see "Hi!" appear!

## What's Next?

### Immediate
- âœ… System is running - explore the interface
- âœ… Load BIOS and watch it execute
- âœ… Try the BIOS commands
- âœ… Write simple test programs

### Short Term  
- Write more complex programs
- Add more BIOS commands (edit `src/bios.asm`)
- Create a library of useful routines

### Long Term
- Build a simple operating system!
- Add file system simulation
- Implement a shell/command interpreter
- Create games or applications

## Build Commands Reference

### Build Everything
```bash
cd /home/kde/Documents/8085_bios
make
```

### Build Just BIOS
```bash
python3 tools/assemble.py src/bios.asm build/bios.bin
```

### Build Just Emulator
```bash
make quick
```

### Clean and Rebuild
```bash
make clean
make
```

### Run
```bash
./8085_bios_system
```

## The Python Assembler

Since the ASL package in Fedora repositories isn't the Macroassembler we needed, I created a custom Python assembler that:

- âœ… Handles all common 8080/8085 instructions
- âœ… Supports labels and forward references
- âœ… Understands EQU, ORG, DB, DW directives
- âœ… Parses hex (h suffix or 0x prefix), decimal, binary
- âœ… No external dependencies beyond Python 3
- âœ… Easy to extend with new instructions

You can use it to assemble any 8080/8085 program!

## Troubleshooting

**Q: GUI doesn't appear**
A: Check if it's already running: `ps aux | grep 8085_bios`

**Q: Can't type in terminal**
A: Click inside the terminal area to give it focus

**Q: BIOS doesn't output anything**
A: Make sure you clicked "Load BIOS" then "Run"

**Q: Want to modify BIOS**
A: Edit `src/bios.asm`, then run `make` to rebuild

**Q: Assembler errors**
A: Check the syntax - see `src/bios.asm` for examples

## Success Metrics âœ…

- âœ… Created Python-based 8080/8085 assembler
- âœ… Assembled 680-byte BIOS ROM successfully  
- âœ… Built Qt5 GUI emulator with interactive terminal

- âœ… System is running and ready to use
- âœ… Ready for OS development!

## Summary

You now have a **complete, working 8085 BIOS system**:

1. âœ… **Assembler**: Python script that assembles 8080/8085 code
2. âœ… **BIOS**: 680-byte monitor ROM with interactive commands
3. âœ… **Emulator**: Enhanced version of your original emulator  
4. âœ… **GUI**: Interactive terminal for real console I/O
5. âœ… **Build System**: Makefile that ties it all together

**The system is running RIGHT NOW** - start experimenting! ðŸš€

Load the BIOS, run it, and start developing programs or even your own operating system!
